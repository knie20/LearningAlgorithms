This repository contains the Python code for:

	Learning Algorithms: A Programmer's Guide to Writing Better Code
	http://oreil.ly/learn-algorithms
	George T. Heineman
	ISBN: 978-1-49-209106-6
	
Each chapter has its own folder containing the code for that chapter.
All Python code conforms to Python 3.4 and has been tested to work as far
back as Python 3.3. While the core algorithms presented in the book
will continue to work with earlier versions of Python, some code used
to generate the tables and images in the book will not compile properly
because of changes to Python libraries.

## Chapter structure

In addition to the code related to a chapter, each folder contains three 
specific Python scripts:

* `book.py` - Generates the tables and data used for figures in the book
* `challenge.py` - Contains the solutions for the challenge exercises at
                 the end of each chapter
* `timing.py` - Scripts that may take a significant amount of time to 
              complete are pulled out separately
* `test.py` - test cases to validate the algorithms and supporting methods.

A separate `algs` folder contains Python scripts that are shared across
the different chapters.

## Documentation

The code documentation style follows standard Python documentation style. The
supporting scripts (i.e., `book.py`, `timing.py`, `test.py`) typically have no
documentation.

Sample output for all executions is provided in doc folder.

## Resources

A dictionary of 321,129 English words is provided in the `words.english.txt` 
file and is used to provide sample inputs throughout the book.

A TMG graph file containing a representation of highways in Massachusetts is 
graciously provided by James Teresco from https://travelmapping.net/graphs

## Installation

First make sure Python3 is installed on your system. The following steps
show how to install Python on a windows operating system even if you do
not have administrator privileges:

	1. Download MSI file from python web site
	
	   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.0/python-3.3.0.amd64.msi for example is
	   what you would do to install Python 3.3.0, which is the earliest version for
	   which this code base is compatible. Please consider using the latest version
	
	2. Invoke MSI installer from command line, using the command as suggested by the
	   older Python2.4 documentation (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4/msi/)
	
	   msiexec /a python-3.3.0.amd64.msi TARGETDIR=C:\YOUR\DESTINATION\FILE
	
	3. Now switch to the directory which contains the LearningAlgorithms code base.
	
	4. modify launch.bat to update proper location for 'python3'
	
	   C:\YOUR\DESTINATION\FILE\Python33\python.exe

## Dependencies

The code depends on [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
and [networkx](https://networkx.org/). If these libraries are not installed, 
the scripts continue to operate in degraded fashion. 

numpy and scipy are only used to model and perform analysis on data 
and runtime performance. networkx is used to construct graphs, and if 
this library is not installed, a replacement graph structure is used which 
is not efficient or suitable for production use.

## Images

All of the tables in the book are reproducible from the Python `book.py` scripts 
found in each chapter. Many of the images will also be generated from
these tables: these generates files are placed (by chapter number) 
within the `images` directory.

## Testing

You can generate code coverage reports for the test cases after you install
the coverage module with:

    pip install coverage

Then in the top directory, execute the following commands to generate code
coverage data and then present it as an HTML directory (found in `htmlcov`).
Make sure your PYTHONPATH includes the current directory.
There is a .coveragerc file that ensures only the book code is targeted.
If you have not installed the coverage module, then replace each 
"coverage run" below with just "python3" and remove the "-a" command 
line option, which is there just to ask coverage to append coverage
data across multiple runs.

    coverage run -m unittest discover
    coverage run -a book.py
    coverage html

The test cases execute within 15 minutes or so. The book takes up to six hours
to fully run, since it generates all tables and data for figures in the book.
If you want to complete all timing results, then add those as well:

    coverage run -a ch01/timing.py
    coverage run -a ch02/timing.py
    coverage run -a ch03/timing.py
    coverage run -a ch04/timing.py
    coverage run -a ch05/timing.py
    coverage run -a ch07/timing.py

Each chapter has challenge exercises that have been completely solved, these
can be executed from each chNN/challenge.py file.

The `coverage.bat` executable performs full coverage and takes about eight
hours to complete. 

## Statistics

The following code statistics are generated using the cloc tool
(https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc), excluding the `ch03\perfect`
directory which contains the generated Python code for perfect
hashtables.

`perl cloc-1.86.pl LearningAlgorithms --exclude-dir=perfect,htmlcov`

     120 unique files.

## Executable programs

Aside from the `book.py`, `challenge.py`, `test.py` and `timing.py` scripts that can be  
found in each chapter, there are some standalone Python scripts that can be executed:

* `ch03.perfect` - computes a perfect hash table for its input.
* `ch03.base26` - computes base26() computations shown in chapter 3.
* `cho3.months` - prints the examples from chapter 3 .
* `ch07.maze` - visualizes the maze in Figure 7-3. Feel free to change parameters to visualize mazes of different size.
* `ch07.replacement` - runs test cases for the replacement code for networkx.
* `ch07.search` - visualize result of Breadth First Search on sample maze.
* `ch07.solver_bfs` - animates Breadth First Search on a larger maze. Change parameter `refresh_rate` to `0.001` to slow down.
* `ch07.solver_dfs` - animates Depth First Search on a larger maze. Parameter `refresh_rate` is `0.001` so you can see its execution.
* `ch07.solver_guided` - animates Guided Search on a larger maze. Parameter `refresh_rate` is `0.001` so you can see its execution.
* `ch07.spreadsheet` - simulates a small spreadsheet application with 5 columns and 3 rows. Formulas can be infix expressions with parentheses.
* `ch07.tmg_load` - loads Massachusetts highway data set and visualizes waypoints and highway segments.
* `ch07.viewer` - visualizes a 50x50 rectangular maze with `salt` of 0.05. Change to 0 and results is a perfect rectangular maze.
* `ch07.xlsx_example` - application loads up an actual (though small) XLSX document containing the Fibonacci example from Figure 7-11. 


## Ideas for Improvement
- add worksheets module
- worksheets.[ch1, ch2, ch3...]
- each worksheet.chx has a lib.py and [challenge1, challenge2, challenge3...].py
- lib.py contains defs of functions
- challengex.py has the implementations of the lib functions, along with the empirical observations
- the lib and challengex separation is so that the timeit module doesn't execute any empirical observation code while importing stuff

- Add guide for VSCode Debugging
- Add guide for following libraries for fresher python users:
  - scipy
  - numpy
  - networkx
  - Datatable
  - timeit
